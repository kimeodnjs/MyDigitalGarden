## 1. The Electromagnetic Spectrum; Elementary Properties of Radiation
<hr>

&ensp;Electromagnetic radiation can be decomposed into a *spectrum* of constituent components by a prism, grating, or other devices.

<br>

&ensp;The spectrum corresponds to waves of various wavelengths and frequencies, where
$$\lambda\nu = c$$

<br>

- **$\lambda$:** $Wavelength$
+ **$\nu$:** $Frequency$
- **$c$:** $3 \times 10^{10} cm{\,}s^{-1}$
